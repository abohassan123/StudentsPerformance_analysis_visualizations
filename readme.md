The data consists of information regarding 1,000 students, including
parental level of education, gender, and other students information The dataset can be found in kaggle

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the
all feauters and most of the feauters are highly correleted and that make the relations between the 
featuers which i get easly find a great Conclusion 

-Males are doing better than females in maths

-Females are doing better than females in writing and reading

-Parent education affected with the results of the students, the Students whose parents have completed master's or bachleor's degree
 have not failed in any subject otherwise the highest rate of failuer with the Students whose parents have some high school.

-The students who completed Test Preparation course no one of them fail

-the avarge highest grades at all 3 subjects and the total score happened at group "E" 
and the lowest avarge grade at all 3 subjects and the total score happened at group "A"

-percentage of success = 98.5% and percentage of failed 1.5% 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on level of uducation, gender  and race and its relation between other feauters ,
first i used the bar plot to show the Categorical featuers with more than 2 var 
and used the bie chart with Categorical featuers with  2 var 
then with numeric featuers  i used hist plot to show the distribution  
next to Bivariate and multivariate i used clusterd plots 
and alot of plots shown the relation between the feauters
